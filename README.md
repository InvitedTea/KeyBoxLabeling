# KeyBoxLabeling

The vastness of detailed smart contract audit reports often leaves critical vulnerabilities unnoticed due to their length and complexity. Keybox Labeling addresses this gap by leveraging AI to parse these reports, creating a streamlined database of categorized vulnerabilities. This initiative aims to make Ethereum's ecosystem safer by enabling easier identification and rectification of potential security risks in smart contracts.
